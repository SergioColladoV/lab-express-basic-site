        <p>David Jon Gilmour CBE (born 6 March 1946) is an English musician who was a member of the
            progressive rock band Pink Floyd. He joined the group as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly
            before the departure of founding member Syd Barrett. Pink Floyd achieved international success with the
            concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s,
            they had become one of the best-selling and most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012, the band had sold
            more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million units sold in the United States. Following
            the departure of Roger Waters in 1985, Pink Floyd continued under Gilmour's leadership and released three
            more studio albums.</p>
